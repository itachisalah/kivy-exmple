# Nature With Kivy

This is a personal project that translates the book [**Nature of Code**](https://natureofcode.com) from Java to Python, and visualize it in Kivy. Hence the name, __Nature With Kivy__.

## About the book
Written by Daniel Shiffman, **Nature of Code** is an awesome book talking about programming and simulating nature phenomenon with the software [Processing](https://processing.org/). It covers the basics like *Random Walk*, *Forces*, *Oscillation*, and goes all the way till rather complex yet interesting topics like *Genetic Algorithm*, *Cellular Automata* and *Neural Networks*. You can either read the book for free online, or buy a printed version from his [website](https://natureofcode.com/book/).

## About Kivy
Kivy is a open-source Python library that helps programmer to build applications with graphical user interface. The application can be deployed on different mainstream platforms like Windows, Mac Os, Android, Raspberry...etc. In addition, wide variety of widgets available and multi-touch support make it easy to build interactive games or animation. More info about Kivy can be found [here](https://kivy.org/#home).

## Overview
The folders in this repository are roughly structured according to the chapters organized in the book. Each file in the folder corresponds to an exercise given in the book. You can check out my answer to the exercise by running the command `python FILENAME.py`, provided you have Kivy installed in your computer. Some mathematical or not visualizable exercises are skipped, since I am focusing more on the visualization part in this project.

### Documentation
More detailed about how I understood the book and the code, along with other spontaneous ideas, are documented in my personal [site](https://theuncertaintim.github.io/NatureWithKivy/Preface/). This project started at the end of July 2019, and I will try to keep my progress updated on a weekly basis.
